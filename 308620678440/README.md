# Readme
Contains the terraform files used for infra as code work on my personal AWS account.

The "vpc directory has all the coded needed to deploy vpc with subnets, routes, etc."
Other directories have IAC code for AWS resource deployment via terraform.

Warning: some of these don't work reliably.
For follow up see [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs).
